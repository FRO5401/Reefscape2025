The robot needs the main model stored in a Robot_{name} folder in a glb type file
The main robot model should be stored in the model.glb file
The subsystems you want to control, should be stored in model_{index}
    These should start with 0 and increase from there
In the Robot_{name}
    Create a json file called config.json;
    this will be where the configuration of the parts should be stored
The main robot configuration will be set up first:
    {
        "name": "string",
        "rotations": [
            {
            "axis": "x",
            "degrees": #
            },
            {
            "axis": "z",
            "degrees": #
            }
        ],
        "position": [
            number, 
            number, 
            number
        ],
    }
    The rotations is the direction of the robot, most of the time axis x is 90, and z is also 90
    The position is the position of the robot, this has to be moved to the origin, 
    so a properly centered cad model will be al 0's, 
    but if its not, you will have to manually change this
    
    Next is Components, so the subsytems you want to control
    "components": [
    {
      "zeroedRotations": [
        {
          "axis": "x",
          "degrees": #
        },
        {
          "axis": "z",
          "degrees": #
        }
      ],
      "zeroedPosition": [
        number, 
        number, 
        number
      ] 
    }
    ]
    This is the same as above, but the zeroed Position is the spot it belongs in the model
